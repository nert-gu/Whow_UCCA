Empty the pockets .
Overalls have more pockets than pants .
The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket .
Kids put rocks , candy , and bugs in these .
Men put cell phones and small tools in them .
Women defy the laws of purse-space , so when it comes to bib pockets , the sky is the limit .
Make sure all the pockets are empty .
Move the strap adjusters around .
You â€™ve probably got them just the way you like them , but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally , the straps will last longer .
Depending on the adjusters , you may be able to leave them a little loose too .
The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles ( not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes ) .
Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing .
This is the same idea as rotating tires .
You know about rotating your tires , do n't you ?
Tips
If you wash your overalls alone or in a light load , use about half the detergent called for and less water .
Leave the straps fastened and twist-tied to the bib when you throw them in the dryer .
This will cut down on some of the racket , but you 're still going to hear them .
Warnings
The paper-type twist ties will deteriorate a little , but the dryer filter screen will catch the fallout .
Plastic-type twist ties will hold up in the wash , but may or may not melt in your dryer .
Use with caution .
