Exclaim that you 've lost a beast .
When the elevator is going from the bottom floor to the top , as soon as the doors close , exclaim that you lost your tarantula / snake / scorpion but confirm that it is somewhere in the elevator .
Most people will probably see that this is a joke .
However , if somebody looks seriously alarmed or is starting to panic , let them know that you were not being serious .
Build in or add something to the elevator .
For example , build a Lego city in the middle of the elevator .
Lay a Twister mat on the floor and ask people if they want to play .
Talk to people .
When there are a lot of people , say , " You 're probably wondering why I 've gathered you here today . "
