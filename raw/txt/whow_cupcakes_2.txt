Method 1 of 2 : Basic Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes .
Preheat the oven to 180 oC / 350 oF .
Prepare the muffin tray by adding cupcake holders / cases .
Put to one side .
Alternatively , use a silicone cupcake baking sheet with molded holes .
Put the cider vinegar into a small bowl and add the soy milk .
Stir this well and then put to one side .
The mixture will now curdle and this is what should be happening .
Stir together the flour , sugar , baking powder , baking soda and salt .
If you want chocolate cupcakes , add cocoa ( about 1/2 cup ) to this stage .
Stir the oil and vanilla extract into the bowl containing the soy milk and vinegar .
Mix together .
Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat together ( by hand or with an electric hand-held mixer ) .
Fill the muffin pan .
Usually fill each paper cupcake holder with about 1/4 cup of batter .
If you prefer larger cupcakes , then add a half a cup but make sure the muffin pan is larger and the cupcake holders are bigger .
Bake for 18 - 20 minutes .
If you can smell the cupcakes earlier , check to make sure they are n't browning earlier ( this means they 're more than ready ) .
If you are n't certain , turn off the oven earlier and let them sit for a few more minutes rather than bake them into rocks .
Wait for the pan to cool down .
Place cupcakes onto a wire rack to cool .
Ice the cupcakes .
The flavor of icing or frosting can be improved by adding a little of your favorite juice to it instead of soy milk or water .
Finished .
