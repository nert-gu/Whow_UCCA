Method Two of Two : Reducing Stress in the Chicken
Understand the hypnotic effect .
Researchers call this effect " tonic immobility " .
" When a chicken or another animal with this tendency becomes frightened , its heart rate lowers and it stops moving .
This may be an attempt to play dead , discouraging predators that prefer live prey .
Unlike an opossum , the chicken gives an unconvincing act , as it continues to blink and breathe in an obvious way . "
Keep the chicken upright or on its side .
While it 's not uncommon to transport a chicken by its feet , this upside-down hold risks breaking the chicken 's hip .
Hypnosis techniques that involve laying a chicken on its back may " succeed " by cutting off its air supply .
This can cause the chicken significant discomfort , leading to fainting or even , rarely , death .
