Challenge their worldview .
Do n't be aggressive –– just skeptical and curious .
If they get upset , gauge their anger .
If it 's minimal , they may be simply having a bad day .
But if they 're enraged , then they may see you as questioning their ' perfect little world . '
And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance .
At some point or another , most people realize that the world does n't revolve around them .
Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them , and get angry if they 're reminded of the real world .
Ambiguity frightens arrogant people because it suggests imperfection , change and lack of certainty ( realities we all must contend with as best we can ) .
As such , instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one 's preferences , the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone , which of course , is an impossible mission .
Reality hurts when it intrudes ; as such , an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyse , thereby not seeing their own imperfections .
They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances .
