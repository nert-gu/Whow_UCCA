Give yourself a break .
If you ca n’t seem to focus and are working half-heartedly at your tasks , give yourself a brief break .

Do whatever it is you ’ve been daydreaming about so that the temptation is removed once you get back to work .
Just be sure to follow through with your deadline rather than ignoring it when your alarm finally goes off .
