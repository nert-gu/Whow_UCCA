How to Detect Arrogant People
Do you always seem to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves , intolerant of people different from them , rude or downright arrogant ?
These people can be a great source of potential pain , and this article is here to help you sort the arrogant from the not-so-arrogant .
Steps
Pay attention to their conversations .
Do n't eavesdrop , but when they 're talking to you or to those around you , listen to them .
Is it always about them ?
Do they get mad or irritated if the centre of attention moves to someone else ?
These are good signs of arrogance .
Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience , and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience " have got something over them " .
Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning ( actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability ) , arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited , narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others .
Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own / have that you do n't .
Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good .
When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you .
This happens when you question ( or at least seem to question ) their appearance , intelligence , athletic abilities , or anything else relating to their self-image .
