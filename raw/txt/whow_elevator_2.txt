Talk to your reflection in the mirror .
Many elevators have mirrors on the walls .
A great way to be mischievous in an elevator is to carry on a running commentary while you look at yourself in the mirror .
You could look at yourself , turning to catch different angles and say “ All right , all right , now we ’re talking , ” very loudly .
You could also keep adjusting your shirt or your hair , keeping a running dialogue about what look is best for you .
Stand in the corner of the elevator facing the wall .
Do n't say anything the whole ride .
Dance to the elevator music .
Many elevators play music in the background , usually soft rock or smooth jazz .
If you ’re in an elevator that is playing music , start to dance .
Start just bobbing your head and tapping your feet , and then get your whole body into it .
Take up as much space as you can to dance until everyone is staring at you . [ 3 ]
Announce every floor .
At every floor , make a loud announcement telling everyone the floor number .
Say something like “ Everyone going to floor ten , get off now ! No time to dilly dally ! ” [ 4 ]
You can also pretend to conduct people onto the elevator , saying “ All aboard the elevator train ! ”
