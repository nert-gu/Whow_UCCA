Choose great material .
You can find fodder lots of places — from your life , joke files online , by repurposing jokes you ’ve heard in the past , and so on .
You may want to start your own joke file .
You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer . [ 1 ]
The latter option may allow for easier revision .
Decide on a target .
Every joke has a “ target , ” which is what the joke is about .
It ’s important that the joke ’s target ( the most basic element of your material ) be suited to your audience .
Make sure it ’s a target your audience will be interested in and something they ’re likely willing to laugh at . [ 2 ]
For example , husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa ;
students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous .
Have a realistic but exaggerated setup .
The opening of the joke — or setup — should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it , but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge . [ 3 ]
Think of the setup as the foundation of a story .
It ’s a fundamental part of the joke ;
if you do n’t lay a good foundation here , then the punchline wo n’t make sense to the audience or they wo n’t find it humorous .
Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny —
it ’s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny . [ 4 ]
The exaggeration can be slight or considerable —
it just depends on the individual joke .
