Watch as the chemical compound creates a colorful glow .
Take your glowsticks to the party and charge your friends loads of money for them !
But act quickly ...
the glow wo n't last very long .
Expectations crushed ?
Method two to the rescue !
The reaction that the luminol and hydrogen peroxide creates does n't last long at all -- maybe a couple of minutes .
For something that lasts hours , go to the next method ( which is a lot easier to facilitate if you have access to a laboratory , but it 's still worth mentioning ) .
