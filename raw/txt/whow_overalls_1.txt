Steps
Wash alone or with " like " clothing .
It ’s best to wash adults ’ overalls alone , especially men ’s .

Think similar clothing , minus the twisty-ness .
Just do the denim and canvas stuff together .
Fasten the straps to the bib .

Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash .
This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash .
Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened .
This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run .
Do n’t skip it .
Take the 20 seconds to use a couple twist ties on the fasteners to make sure they do n’t come loose .
If your washing machine is worth its salt , it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it .
All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience .
