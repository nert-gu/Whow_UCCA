Keep a notebook by hand before you start your workday .
Write every thought down that comes up during work .
Every single to do or things you want to do at that specific moment .
Do n't do it , put it on a list and do it later .
This prevents you from getting into the " procrastination zone . "
Finish the hard stuff .
When you have a looming project that 's bogging you down and making you unproductive in other areas , tackle it first .
Finishing the largest item on your list of things to do will make you feel extra productive and give you the boost to do other things you ’ve been pushing to the side .
If your “ big project ” is something that ca n’t be done in one sitting , make a list of small parts of it that you can accomplish today .
Do n’t worry about completing the entire thing , but take steps now so that doing so in the future is a breeze .
Make an ultimate to-do list for this single project , and have it placed somewhere you will see it on a regular basis .
As you mark things off , you will be motivated to continue doing so , and seeing it on a regular basis will remind you that your project needs to be done .
Do two-minute tasks .
Whenever you are presented with something that you do n’t want to do or would consider putting off , ask yourself , “ will this take me less than two minutes to finish ? ”
For many of us , this includes small chores , like taking out the trash or pulling a few weeds , but can include simple tasks in all areas of life .
Anything that you want to put off but takes two minutes to do - do it .
Simply force yourself to use the next 120 seconds to be productive and do the duty you normally would push off for hours or days . [ 1 ] .
