Tips
You can add pureed fruit for delicious flavor changes .
One small container of pureed fruit is sufficient for flavoring ( the little containers that children take to school in their lunchboxes . )
Try strawberry , apple , banana , apricot , peach etc .
The cupcakes will not be as light and fluffy , however , so be prepared for a heavier cupcake if you add fruit but the added moisture content is a definite plus .
Instead of using vegan sugar , you can replace it with equal parts maple sugar or rice syrup
Instead of using vegetable oil , try substituting it for walnut or macadamia nut oils if they are available to you .
Coconut oil also produces good results .
And olive oil works fine if it 's all that 's left in the pantry .
You can replace the plain soy milk with other flavors like chocolate or vanilla if you want to experiment with changing the flavor of the cupcakes .
Experiment with the flavors of either recipe by replacing the vanilla extract with fragrant ingredients like neroli orange oil , rosewater , orange blossom water or coconut extract .
