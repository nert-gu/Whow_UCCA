How to Tell a Joke
Two Parts :
Getting the Material Right
Getting the Delivery Right
From one-liners to classic three-liners to the one-minute gag you tell your friends , a good joke pleases everyone .
Joke-telling is one of the best ways to ease tension , make a new friend , or light up a room .
That is , of course , if you can get a laugh .
Telling good jokes is an art that comes naturally to some people , but for others it takes practice and hard work .
Part 1 of 2 :
Getting the Material Right
Know your audience .
All aspects of the joke you tell , from the content to the length , need to be suited to your audience .
What ’s funny to a group of 20-year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70-year old - uncle laugh ( then again , maybe not ) .
Everyone ’s an individual , so there are no hard and fast rules .
But , unless you personally know the members of your audience , here are some good rules of thumb to follow :
elderly people wo n’t like crude jokes ;
stay away from misogynist jokes if you ’ve got an audience full of women ;
people of a specific ethnic or racial group wo n’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group ;
and jokes requiring specialized knowledge ( of , for example , science or old movies ) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge .
The more you know about your audience the better you ’ll be able to tailor your jokes to them .
