Learn the quality of their friendships .
Do n't be nosy or gossipy , but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next , that 's a sign of them having a lot of fair weather friends .
That 's a sign of arrogance , since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who 's stuck on themselves .
Prideful people have a strong need to look good , and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that .
Since being a good friend to someone usually means helping them , they often ca n't stand the thought of a good friendship .
Ironically , arrogant people often ca n't understand why they do n't have any reliable and supportive friends .
How do they treat those not like themselves ?
In other words , how do they treat those with different beliefs , cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world ?
If it 's inherently negative , then they 're either over-zealous , ignorant of other people or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only .
Determine this based on their general personality and the people they 're interacting with .
Many times prideful people have a serious ' my-way's-the-only-way ' attitude .
This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land .
