How to Play Muggle Quidditch
In the Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling the main wizarding sport is Quidditch .
However you do n't have to have magical powers to play .
There are many different ways of playing Quidditch , but the most commonly used set of rules are those given by the International Quidditch Association ( which can be found here ) .
In the past Muggle Quidditch has mainly been played at colleges in the US , but over the last few years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of community teams .
Quidditch has also spread outside of America and is now played on 5 continents .
Steps
Gather all needed materials and players ( see Things You 'll Need section below ) .
Know that all players can play while riding a broom .
Brooms can be a hindrance however , so feel free to not use brooms .
Place the quaffle and three bludgers in the middle of the field .
Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated so that they are easier to throw and catch .
Start the game .
Both teams start from the edges and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers .
Follow your duty depending what type of player you are :
Chasers try to score by throwing the quaffle into one of the three goal hoops .
Each score is worth 10 points .
Beaters try to peg players with their bludger .
If a player is pegged they have to stop what they 're doing and pay a penalty ; i.e. ( drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser ) and run back to and touch their goal post or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds .
Keepers guard the goal posts at each end and attempt to block chasers ' attempts at scoring .
If Keeper is close to their hoops they are safe from being hit by bludgers .
