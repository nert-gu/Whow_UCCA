Make sure that it is a language that while speaking , you do n't get a literal knot in your tongue !
Remember you should know how to write it .
For example we write it from left to right , in Arabic it 's right to left , Chinese is in columns , and so on .
Make sure that you and your friend(s) all follow a systematic language system .
In other words , make sure that you follow the same guidelines .
Do n't use random letters .
It should make some sense , so that it will be easier to learn and speak with [ Example : Do n't use oh as e , hello as llo , and See ya as c yah ) .
Make sure you practice saying and spelling out many basic words in your language , English examples : is , who , when , of , why , if , what , where , can , may , etc .
When starting off , follow closely to a language you like .
This will make grammar much easier to make .
You must avoid simply copying the grammar rules , however , as this would technically turn your language into a code .
Practice your language frequently so that you do n't forget it !
Do n't forget punctuation !
As a shortcut , and for a bit of interesting background , add connotation to various letters , preferably vowels .
To do this , think of various words that begin with / have a lot of a certain vowel .
For example : austere , acrimony , ebullient , embolden ; in this case , the vowel A might carry with it a negative meaning , whereas E would be positive .
Then , even if you forget your own words without the help of your dictionary , you could still make a good guess based on the composition of the letters .
