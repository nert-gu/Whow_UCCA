Tips
Alternatively the snitch can be a small yellow ball ( tennis balls work great ) that is hidden before the game starts by a bystander or referee .
Establish boundaries and have the seekers look for the snitch .
Beaters can try hitting the bludgers around in the air with a shortened hockey sticks or a short bat .
They could also use regular-length hockey sticks to hit bludgers ( perhaps wiffle balls ) on the ground .
The simplest way is to just peg players by throwing dodge balls .
It may be easier to play without brooms ( but also less fun ! ) .
Remember that the snitch runner , if you choose to use one , is not an actual player in the game , therefore , not bound by any of the rules .
If desired , the snitch is able to do whatever he or she wants to avoid capture .

Play while the seekers look for the snitch .
Another variation is where the referee places the snitch somewhere in the field ( in this case it 's a small ball ) .
The seeker has to find the snitch blindfolded , relying only on the coach 's instructions , while the game is still on .
