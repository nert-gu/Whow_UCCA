How to Make a Glowstick
Those glowing Mountain Dew videos with peroxide and baking soda are all hoaxes .
To truly make a glowstick without breaking an already-made glowstick and shoving its contents into a tube ( also known as cheating ) , you 've gotta let your inner scientist out ( along with a few dollars ) .
If you 're still curious , read on .
This is fun for anyone and everyone .
Method One of Two : Using Luminol
Put on protective glasses .
In addition , wear gloves to protect your skin .
It 's also a good idea to not wear your Sunday best .
Throw on some old clothes or put a smock over clothes you want protected .
Some of this stuff is dangerous -- this experiment is not meant for children !
Listen up , kids : You 'll be working with a solution that 's near a 12 on the pH scale .
That basically means do n't swallow it , do n't put it in your eyes , do n't bathe in it , and do n't really expose yourself to it directly at all .
Got it ?
Moving on .
Combine 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide and a liter of distilled water in a mixing bowl .
A ceramic bowl will work best , but plastic works too .
Use funnels , measuring tubes , and basters to keep everything well-measured and well away from you .
Hydrogen peroxide is used to replace the luminol 's nitrogen atoms with oxygen .
When that happens , all the substances create a rave and start partying and electrons fly everywhere and what results ?
The glow .
