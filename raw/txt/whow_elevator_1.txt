How to Annoy People in Elevators
An elevator is almost the perfect environment to be a prankster .
It ’s easy to annoy people when you are cramped in such a small , tight space .
Because elevator rides usually last less than a minute , make sure your pranks are quick and have a lot of punch .
When annoying people on an elevator , keep your pranks lighthearted and fun as opposed to mean-spirited so that everyone leaving the elevator will have a pleasant story to tell .
Method 1 Using the Elevator to Annoy People
Push all the buttons .
When you get into the elevator , push the button for every floor .
This makes everyone ’s ride on the elevator longer , if only for a few seconds .
If you want to take it a step further , look around questioningly at everyone in the elevator when no one gets off at the floors you pushed . [ 1 ]
When someone comes in , say , " I 've got this , " before you push all of the buttons .
You can also push all the buttons as you reach the floor you are getting off at .
If someone asks you why you pushed all the buttons , you can honestly say , " It was just a joke ! "
Make a dinging noise at each floor .
Every time the elevator reaches a new floor , say “ ding ! ” very loudly .
You can even sing the word “ ding ” on each floor like notes in a scale , getting higher as you reach each new floor . [ 2 ]
You can make other noises if you prefer , such as a bird cawing or an explosion sound every time a button is pushed .
