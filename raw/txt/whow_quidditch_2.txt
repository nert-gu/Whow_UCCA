Seekers try to tackle the snitch ( a person ) or obtain an object attached to the snitch such as a sock or flag .
You can establish you own rules as to how a player catches the snitch .
A common way to play is to make the snitch a person , and give the snitch a head start to run and hide in defined boundaries .
Then the seekers search for the snitch , and attempt to tag the player .
Other methods , such as the method adopted in 2005 , makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock , hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner .
Regardless of method , the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team , unlike the books , in which the snitch is worth 150 points .
The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought that it was worth too many points so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch .
The snitch , generally a track runner , runs around ( usually the boundaries ) trying to evade the seekers .
The referee should ensure that rules are being followed .
They also keep track of the score .
Play the game !
The object of the game is to score the most points and the game ends when the seeker snatches the snitch .
Feel free to alter the game rules .
