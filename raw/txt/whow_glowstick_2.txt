Mix .2 grams of luminol , 4 grams of sodium carbonate , .4 grams of copper sulfate , .5 grams of ammonium carbonate and 1 liter ( 0.3 US gal ) of distilled water in a second bowl .
It is important not to touch the luminol .
Use a funnel to make everything safe and easy .
Unfortunately , these hazardous chemicals will not float freely in mid-air like this graphic suggests .
Yep , unless you 're a coroner or some sort of crazy spy / criminologist you probably do n't have this stuff lying around the house ( hopefully not ... ) .
If you 're dead set on starting your own glowstick business ( worse ideas exist ) , try websites like Alfa Aesar [ 1 ] or Sigma Aldrich [ 2 ] for supplies .
Mix everything well .
Do n't use your hands -- use a metal or plastic utensil of some sort .
Clean the containers and dry them thoroughly .
It 's important to use sanitary , clean tubes for your glowsticks .
The last thing you want is other substances interacting with the reactions you 're depending on to make the substances glow .
Set the correct lid next to each container .
This enables you to seal the containers quickly after filling .
It 's not like the glow will get up and run away from you , but still .
Combine equal amounts of the first and second solution in the container and close the bottles .
Shake them up once the lids are on tightly .
Then turn off the lights !
If it 's not already glowing , something went wrong .
Do over !
