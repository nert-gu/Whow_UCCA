Know your material .
Practicing your joke is crucial .
You do n’t need to have it completely memorized — in fact , you " should n’t " memorize it — but you need to be really comfortable with it , so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked , which is very possible once you ’re in front of an audience .
Memorized jokes sound wooden , like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer .
Good jokes have a lot of details and personality , so do n’t be afraid to embellish . [ 7 ]
Try different things out and see what feels right , what sounds best .
Do n’t use a joke until you ’re completely comfortable with it .
Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself .
If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s , your joke isn ’t ready and you need to practice more . [ 8 ]
You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you ’re ready for a “ real ” audience .
