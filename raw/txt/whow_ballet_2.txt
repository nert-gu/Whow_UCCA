Always wear ballet slippers .
Properly-fitted ballet shoes should be snug , but not so tight they cut off blood flow and create numbness in the feet .
There are different styles and types of shoes , so ask your ballet teacher or a salesman at the store for advice , given your intentions for dancing .
Do n't buy shoes to grow into , because your feet will seem flexed when you pointe and will look flat .
You should fit them to where the drawstring is tied slightly loose .
If your drawstring is longer than your pinkie then you should cut it off till it is roughly the size of your fingernail .
The drawstring just completes the fit .
It is n't made to tighten overly large shoes .
If you ca n't buy ballet shoes , that it is okay .
Use socks without the stickies on the bottom , so you can turn !
Wear comfortable and snug-fitting athletic clothes .
The most important thing is that you are comfortable , and that you 're not wearing baggy or loose fitting clothing so you can make sure you 're forming and moving correctly in the mirror .
A plain black leotard and pink tights are usually a safe bet .
Pink or black ballet slippers are also appropriate .
If you 're signed up for a class , check with your instructor to find out if there is a dress code at the school .
Some schools may have students wear the same thing and others may just require any type of leotard and tights and sometimes ballet skirts .
Mostly they require tight fitting clothing so they can see that your muscles are working properly and so on .
