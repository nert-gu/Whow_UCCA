Expect impact .
You are unlikely to have the time or ability to aim for a soft landing-spot , body of water , or other impact site that might improve your chances of survival .
There is a minuscule chance that your impact will result in non-life-threatening injuries ;
if this seems incredibly far-fetched , comfort yourself that double chute failure in modern times is also extremely unlikely , and that you have already beaten worse odds .
Tips
Your reserve chute should have been packed by a certified rigger and is moderately less likely to fail ;
therefore , it may be helpful to focus your efforts on opening your reserve parachute .
Some humans who have , for various reasons , become aware of their impending death , develop psychological coping strategies to deal with this ;
for instance , the Kubler-Ross phases of grief .
Since your own death approaches far more quickly , this is unlikely to be of any use to you .
Warnings
Water landings : if you have successfully attached to a companion whose chute opens , keep in mind that both your arms may be broken or dislocated , and you may be unable to swim or tread water before your chute fills and drags you under .
If , after total chute failure , you land on something soft , it is possible that instead of being killed outright , you may be permanently paralyzed due to spinal injury .
If you have a strong aversion to this outcome , aiming head-downward before impact in the manner of an Olympic diver may ensure the destruction of your cranium and your immediate demise .
