Steps
Create a to-do list .
Yes , make yourself an old fashioned to-do list with check boxes and everything .
List everything , big and small , that you have to do for your entire day ; break big activities into smaller bits if necessary .
Then , as you work through your day , check off each of the items on your list .
You will feel a growing sense of pride as you visually monitor your ever-diminishing list of projects .
Focus your list on including the things you typically put off , not the things you are sure to do on a regular basis .
If necessary , set time-frames for your items to be done by .
For example , list “ take the dog for a walk by 12:30 ” rather than simply “ walk the dog . ”
Re-evaluate your list halfway through your day to rank your items based on highest priority .
Then , tackle the most important ones before looking back at the smaller things to do .
