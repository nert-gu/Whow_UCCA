It 's not completely clear how much stress this hypnosis causes .

Watch for signs of stress .
Abnormal feathering , constant preening , or delays in egg-laying are all signs of a stressed chicken .
While hypnotizing is unlikely to cause serious harm , any type of stress is more damaging to a chicken in this state .
