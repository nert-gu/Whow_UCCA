Method 2 of 2 : Using Grammar
Name your language .
This is the most fundamental property in all languages .
You have many names to choose from .
You can even use a made up word from your made up language like ' Victory ' or ' Great Language ' .
The choice is all yours .
Start off with the highly frequently used words such as ' and ' or ' I ' or ' one ' or ' the ' .
It is recommend that you use short words since they are commonly used .
An example would be ' ant ' for and or ' es ' or even ' loo ' for the word ' and ' .
Start thinking about the grammar rules .
For example if the word Bird is ' Vogelaviatiolap ' then why not make the word Birds ' Vogelaviatiolaps ' since the suffix ' s ' is added at the end for most languages at plurals .
If you want to add complication , you can add genders like most European languages like French and German .
For example , if you want the word ' horse ' to be a boy , you may want ' the horse ' to be ' Mat Fereder ' , but a ' cat ' to be a girl , you may want , ' the cat ' to be ' Fet Kamaow ' .
Consider basing your language on an existing language .
For example , in my made up language , ' Vogelaviatiolap ' means Bird .
If you have n't guessed , it comes from the following :
' Vogel ' comes from German , which means bird
' aviatio ' comes from English .
It 's uncompleted though , because the word is part of the term ' aviation '
' lap ' comes from Onomatopoeia .
It 's a completed term , but it is supposed to come from ' Flap ! '
