Wiggle your finger .
Hold the bird down gently with one hand .
Put one finger on your other hand just in front of its beak tip , without touching it .
Move the finger backward to about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) away , then back again .
Repeat until the chicken stops moving or squawking .
Let go of its legs .
The chicken should be " hypnotized " and cease to struggle .
It will lie there for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes .
Draw a line in front of its beak instead .
If the chicken was n't hypnotized , try this alternative .
Using chalk , a stick , or your finger , draw a line on the ground 12 " ( 30 cm ) long .
Start near the chicken 's beak and draw the line slowly outward , in front of its head .
Wake it up by clapping .
Be nice to your feathered friend and let it get back to its business .
Clap your hands or give it a gentle shove until it jumps up and walks away .
