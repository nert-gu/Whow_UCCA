What 's their personality like ?
Take note of how they act , talk , and use their social status .
Do they have a general sense of ' coolness ? '
Are they a chatterbox ?
Do they act like they own the place , or act like the ' big dog ? '
Are they very keen on their self-image ?
Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through .
But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they do n't like .
When they are cruel , their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it since they 're afraid that they 'll be treated badly by their ' friend . '
Mention people you know that they do n't like .
This is n't meant to begin a conflict , but to gauge their rivalries , annoyances and enmities .
If their condemnation seems to be reasonable , they probably are n't hubristic .
If it 's harsh , they are .
For the most part , arrogant people see people that they do n't like as threats to their perfect little world .
The more they hate someone , the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land .
And in turn , the bigger the threat , the harsher the criticism .
Ask around to see what they 've been saying about you .
If they have been saying bad things about you , they may simply not like you .
If they 're nice to your face , but talk bad about you behind your back like it 's their favourite hobby , then they probably have a problem with pride .
Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they do n't have any good friends .
They compensate for this by creating the impression that they have a lot of friends - they have a ' quantity , not quality ' mentality .
Then they simply insult their trophy friends when they are n't looking .
